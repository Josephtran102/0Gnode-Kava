# Aligned Layer

EigenLayer is a set of smart contracts built on Ethereum that introduces restaking, it enables the reuse of ETH on the consensus layer to validate new software modules built on top of the Ethereum ecosystem. In this way, Ethereum stakers can help secure many services by providing pooled security, this occurs when multiple parties combine their resources to offer enhanced security for a system.
